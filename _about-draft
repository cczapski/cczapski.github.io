I am a McCombs UT grad and an ex sales manager who recently jumped out of my previous position to begin a career in UI Design. I am following my new-found passion of creating visually delightful designs that center around structure, logic and a little bit of common sense. 

As I continue to expand my new skills, I am looking for an organization that shares my goals of continual growth and development.

Excluding the first several years of my life as a military brat, I was raised here in Austin, Texas. I am the middle-child of a proud Polish family and have a sheltie pup named Blue. When I'm not expanding my design and coding skills, you can often find me outdoors in Austin with Blue or with a cold beer in hand next to a refreshing body of water.

Interested in working together? I'd love to hear from you. Choose your contact of preference and connect with me!
