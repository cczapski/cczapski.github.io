short: This project is an exploration of working solely with CSS to style a webpage. The design is inspired by the De Stijl movement of the early 1900's. You can view the original CSS Zen Garden website <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">here</a>.

The design focuses on the combination of primary blue, red, and yellow colors with black and white. Lines are straight, horizontal and vertical with randomly scattered squares and rectangles throughout. 

The typography mirrors the geometric, straight lines of the movement.
