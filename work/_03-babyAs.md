short: This project is a redesign of the 2015 Baby Acapulco's restaurant website. A large focus of the project was exploring typography and accesibility across multiple devices. Please note, this project is not officially affliated with any of the Baby Acapulco restaurants and is simply an <a href="http://theironyard.com/">Iron Yard</a> project.
