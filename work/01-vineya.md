intro: Vineya has been my work focus since I joined Communication Service for the Deaf in October of 2015. As a member of the software development team, I walked into the very early stages of the product development and have seen the project through to release, and now focus on continuous improvements and feature additions.
short: Given proprietary obligations, this product section represents certain elements of my work on the Vineya product that are not limited by confidentiality.

When I started working on Vineya, key visual elements such as colors, typography, icon set and header/navigation layout were already in place. It has been my responsibility to design and manage all other aspects of the product from user experience and user interface perspectives. 

The below pages showcase aspects regarding the product and 
nonproprietary work Iâ€™ve completed on Vineya.

    <h4><a href="/work/vineya/preventing-user-error">Preventing User Error</a></h4>
    <p>Easily entering a job date and time when creating an interpreting job is a critical task for agency and business users, one that I originally did not solve for appropriately. <a href="/work/vineya/preventing-user-error">Check out</a> my improved solution.</p>

<div class="product-link">
    <h4><a href="/work/vineya/client-onboarding">Client Onboarding</a></h4>
    <p>We currently have very limited deaf and hard of hearing client access to the applications, but do allow these users to access the iOS application for Vineya VRI (video remote interpreting) jobs. <a href="/work/vineya/client-onboarding">Here's a look</a> into onboarding these clients in the iOS app.</p>
