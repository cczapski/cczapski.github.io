short: Radlibs is my first ever website design, and the product of a group hackathon project at the <a href="http://theironyard.com/">Iron Yard</a>. For any of you who remember adlibs or madlibs, Radlibs is a play off of those word games, combining a database of randomly generated famous quotes and user input for parts of speech.

#####Goals and the Team
<a href="https://github.com/BenHand">Ben Hand</a>, my Ruby teammate of our Hackathon trio, pitched the idea to create Radlibs as a fun and goofy application, full of nonsense and laughs along the way. With this in mind, we knew our users would expect nothing more than a simple interface with a fun way to focus on the user generated quotes. 

The full trio consisted of <a href="https://github.com/BenHand">Ben Hand</a> (Ruby), <a href="https://twitter.com/jlagrange87">Joshua LeGrand</a> (Front End), and myself. I worked with Adobe Photoshop, HTML, CSS and Sass to complete the fully responsive design, while Josh worked with Javascript and React and Ben with Ruby.

<!-- #####Design Step 1: Sketches

I started with sketches, deciding to make the layout as simple as possible due not only to the time constraints of completing the project in one weekend, but also to match the simple, fun interface our users would be anticipating with the application. 
 -->
<!-- Here's a quick peek at those sketches. -->

    <p class="sketch">
        <img alt="Radlibs Medium Your Quote Sketch" src="/images/work/radlibs/sketch_yourquote_medium.jpg">
    </p>
</div> -->

<!-- #####Design Step 2: Style Tiles

The most obvious style direction was to mimick Mad Libs and give users a reminiscent feeling of the playful books. Version 1 of the style tile employs a soft, but fun color palette with a strong emphasis on black and white to emulate the pages of text in Mad Libs books. 

Felt Tip Roman Heavy, hosted by TypeKit, was the perfect handwritten type for the light-hearted logo. The type throughout the rest of the site needed to emulate the goofy feel, but provide a more legible text type. Signo, also by TypeKit, proved a good match for these qualities.

</p>

Almost immediately I felt version one to be too obvious and easy. I wanted to create a unique identity to Radlibs to display a brighter, more age-diverse color palette and a stronger, more bold statement with the logo type. 

Version 2 holds a much more vibrant palette inspired from a fun color-box discovered during braintstorming, that eventually evolved into the user-generated quote border and Radlibs logo. Azo Sans Uber provided the bolder typeface I was looking for in the title of Radlibs.

#####Challenges
Where a lot of teams struggled with communication over the weekend, Josh, Ben and I managed to communicate with each other very well, fully avoiding any GitHub merge conflicts. 

The main challenges we faced were understanding how each of our pieces would fit together. With constant communication, attempts, errors, and re-attempts, Josh took my design, his front end skills, and Ben's backend magic to glue all elements together and we were successful in creating a fully functioning application by the end of the weekend. -->

#####Final Product
After 72 hours, we completed the Radlibs that you see today hosted on Heroku. Radlibs is accessible on any device. If you haven't checked it out yet, please do - especially if you're in a need of a laugh!
