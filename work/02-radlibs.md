##About
Radlibs is my very first design ever. I completed the project with two wonderful teammates, Ben Hand (Ruby) and Joshua LeGrand (Front End), during an Iron Yard hackathon project (also my very first hackathon ever). For any of you who remember adlibs or madlibs, Radlibs is a play off of those word games, combining a database of randomly generated famous quotes and user input for parts of speech. The goal of the website was to make the user's experience fun and enjoyable, full of goofy nonsense, with some good laughs along the way.

##Process
We kicked off our Thursday collaborating on what exactly we wanted the website to achieve and what each of our first steps would be. We had to first draw out the basic concept of the site, from the home page, to the sign up, the first input page, and the display of the Radlibs quote. I took down which web pages I needed to design and style, and my teammates took notes of what they would need to incorporate to develop our end result. From there, we began our first steps.

###Design Step 1: Sketches

I started with sketches, deciding to make the layout as simple as possible due not only to the time constraints of completing the project in one weekend, but also to match the simple, fun aspect of the website. Here's a quick peek at those sketches.


###Design Step 2: Style Tiles

Once the team all agreed upon the layout from my sketches, I started developing pieces of the style. Again due to time, I decided to create just two styles. As I was thinking of colors and feelings, all I could think of was childhood memories of Madlibs, so I took the first style direction towards mimicking the playful, silly, fun feel of Madlibs. See below.


After I got that style out, I knew that I didn't want to just mimick Madlibs, but create a unique feel to Radlibs. I wanted something more bright, a little more grown up, and something rad. One of my brainstorming methods for getting the right vibe from visual elements on a style tile is to simply google those words together and see what happens.
