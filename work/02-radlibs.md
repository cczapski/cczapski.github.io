short: Radlibs is my first ever website design, and the product of a group hackathon project at the <a href="http://theironyard.com/">Iron Yard</a>. For any of you who remember adlibs or Mad Libs, Radlibs is a play off of those word games, combining a database of randomly generated famous quotes and user input for parts of speech.

<a href="https://github.com/BenHand">Ben Hand</a>, my Ruby teammate of our Hackathon trio, pitched the idea to create Radlibs as a fun and goofy application, full of nonsense and laughs along the way. With this purpose in mind, we knew our users would expect nothing more than a simple interface with a fun way to focus on the user generated quotes. 

The full trio consisted of <a href="https://github.com/BenHand">Ben Hand</a> (Ruby), <a href="https://twitter.com/jlagrange87">Joshua LeGrand</a> (Front End), and myself. I worked with Adobe Photoshop, HTML, CSS and Sass to complete the fully responsive design, while Josh worked with Javascript and React and Ben with Ruby.

After 72 hours, we completed the Radlibs that you see today hosted on Heroku. Radlibs is accessible on any device. If you haven't checked it out yet, please do - especially if you're in a need of a laugh!
