short: Radlibs is my first ever website design, and the product of a group hackathon project at the <a href="http://theironyard.com/">Iron Yard</a>. For any of you who remember adlibs or madlibs, Radlibs is a play off of those word games, combining a database of randomly generated famous quotes and user input for parts of speech.

#####Goals and the Team
The goal of the website was to make the user's experience fun and enjoyable, full of goofy nonsense, with some good laughs along the way. 

I completed the project with two wonderful teammates, <a href="https://github.com/BenHand">Ben Hand</a> (Ruby) and <a href="https://twitter.com/jlagrange87">Joshua LeGrand</a> (Front End) over a weekend in June. I worked with Adobe Photoshop, HTML, CSS and Sass to complete the design, while Josh worked with Javascript and React and Ben with Ruby.

#####Kick Off
We kicked off our Thursday collaborating on what we wanted the website to achieve and what each of our first steps would be. We had to first draw out the basic concept of the site, from the home page, to the sign up, the first input page, and the display of the Radlibs quote. 

I took down which web pages I needed to design and style, and my teammates took notes of what they would need to incorporate to develop our end result. From there, we began our first steps.

#####Design Step 1: Sketches

I started with sketches, deciding to make the layout as simple as possible due not only to the time constraints of completing the project in one weekend, but also to match the simple, fun aspect of the website. Here's a quick peek at those sketches.

        <img alt="Radlibs Medium Your Quote Sketch" src="/images/work/radlibs/sketch_yourquote_medium.jpg">
    </p>
</div>

#####Design Step 2: Style Tiles

Once the team all agreed upon the layout from my sketches, I started developing pieces of the style. As I was thinking of colors and feelings, all I could think of was childhood memories of Madlibs, so I took the first style direction towards mimicking the playful, silly, fun feel of Madlibs.

</p>

After I got that style out, I knew that I didn't want to just mimick Madlibs, but create a unique feel to Radlibs. I wanted something more bright, a little more grown up, and something "rad". One of my brainstorming methods for getting the right vibe from visual elements on a style tile is to simply google those words together and see what happens. 

In this case, I googled rad, bright and fun. Below is the style I developed from brainstorm with that search result, and as a team we agreed this design was the best fit for the goals of the project.

#####Challenges
Where a lot of teams struggled with communication over the weekend, Josh, Ben and I managed to communicate with each other very well, fully avoiding any GitHub merge conflicts. 

The main challenges we faced were understanding how each of our pieces would fit together. With constant communication, attempts, errors, and re-attempts, Josh took my design, his front end skills, and Ben's backend magic to glue all elements together and we were successful in creating a fully functioning application by the end of the weekend.

#####Final Product
After 72 hours, we completed the Radlibs that you see today hosted on Heroku. Radlibs is accessible on any device. If you haven't checked it out yet, please do - especially if you're in a need of a laugh!
