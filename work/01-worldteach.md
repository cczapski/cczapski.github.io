short: WorldTeach is my final project for the accelarated UI Design course at the <a href="http://theironyard.com/">Iron Yard</a>. This project is a fully responsive redesign of the 2015 WorldTeach website completed in two weeks. Please note, this project is not officially affliated with the actual WorldTeach organization and is simply an Iron Yard project.

The core purpose of the WorldTeach redesign is to inspire  individuals to volunteer and support the organization's goals of making education accessible to everyone in the world, while also taking on the challenge of setting itself apart from the hundreds of competitor volunteer organizations in the world.

#####Design Inspiration
In order to achieve the core purpose through design, I found key inspiration from vintage travel posters, which also focus on motivating individuals into action through travel. 

This collage of vintage travel posters captures many of the elements from color and typography that I translated into the design for WorldTeach. The colors are bright, yet warm and inviting. The typography combines both elegant script and bold sans-serifs to emulate the style of the different countries and locations.


#####Key Design Elements
A quick snapshot of the main header shows a few key design elements that relate to the vintage travel theme.

</p>

The WorldTeach wordmark logo inherits the script font and stamp-like texture of Rinse, a type hosted by Typekit. The buttons also take on this passport-like stamp texture, with the patterned dots as key separators inspired by stamp borders.

#####Content Strategy
WorldTeach currently benefits from a wealth of useful information; however, the organization of this information is hardly intuitive or logical, most often confusing or losing users in the site.

A large focus of this project revolved around a more logical path of information and resources to improve the overall user experience. A key solution I created was to first break down the website into user sections and then to structure the content paths from those point of views and main user goals.

#####Final Product
The final product achieves the main goals of inspiring and motivating through the design and provides a fresh, modern look and experience preparing the organization to compete in the volunteer organization market. I built the WorldTeach redesign for accessibility across multiple browsers and devices with responsive web design techniques and best practices.
