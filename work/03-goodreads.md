short: This project is a redesign of the 2015 version of Goodreads' website. With the numerous interactive elements of the site, the project focused on improving the overall flow and layout of the current design to create an intuitive user process. Please note, this project is not officially affliated with the actual Goodreads company and is simply an Iron Yard project.

After user interviews, S.W.O.T. (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis, competitive market analysis and defining the main goals of Goodreads, conclusions proved that most people were overwhelmed with the current site, often getting confused on what steps to take next. My main goal was to improve the general flow and layout of the three focus pages while providing a fun and welcoming feel with the design.

Below are both small and medium device sizes for all three pages.
