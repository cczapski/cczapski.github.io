short: This project is a redesign of the 2015 version of Goodreads' website. With the numerous interactive elements of the site, the project focused on improving the overall flow and layout of the current design while creating an intuitive user process. Please note, this project is not officially affliated with the actual Goodreads company and is simply an Iron Yard project.
