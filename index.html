						<h3>Tabs on Tabs on Tabs</h3>
						<p>July 1, 2015</p>
						<p>I really thought my instructor, the lovely miss Sam Kapila, was just a little bit crazy when I first saw the number of tabs she consistently kept open in not just one, but two or three, browser windows. We’re talking twenty to thirty to fifty (ok, maybe a little excessive with fifty) tabs in just one single browser window . . . <a href="#"><span class="link">Read More</span></a></p>

						<h3>Exploring Typography with Baby A's</h3>
						<p>June 25, 2015</p>
						<p>After much initial frustration attempting to create five different typography styles with TypeCast, a free online tool that happens to be super glitchy (not saving work, etc.), I finally left hours of work and started over in Photoshop. With my slight experience in Photoshop from learning how to make style tiles, I found this process much more successful. . . . <a href="#"><span class="link">Read More</span></a></p>

						<h3>Quitting My Job: 6 Weeks Out</h3>
						<p>June 17, 2015</p>
						<p>Six weeks, has it really only been six weeks? It seems more like 3 months since my Monday through Friday consisted of a rigid, 8 to 5 (well, most often a little outside of that structure, say 7 am to 6 or 7 pm…). As I’ve re-entered the blog posting world (after a very small debut of posts while living in Costa Rica several years ago) . . . <a href="#"><span class="link">Read More</span></a></p>

						<h3>Design Sketch Practice with 10 Websites</h3>
						<p>June 11, 2015</p>
						<p>A couple weeks into the Iron Yard UI Design course and we’ve started to sketch out existing websites. Outside of practice with basic website sketches for future designing, we were focused on visualizing the different grid systems that we thought best suited each of the 10 different websites for homework. . . . <a href="#"><span class="link">Read More</span></a></p>

					<h3>Twitter: A UI Design Student's Love/Hate Relationship</h3>
					<p>June 10, 2015</p>
					<p>I love you.</p>
					<p>In the Iron Yard application, they ask for your Twitter page. Immediately I rushed to my browser, attempted a login to my page to recall just exactly what a prospective school would find about me there. Two years, almost 2 years since my last tweet, and mostly just back and forth bantering with friends . . . <a href="#"><span class="link">Read More</span></a></p>
