						<h3>Structure + Design = Greatness</h3>
						<p>July 22, 2015</p>
						<p>Today I begin my last project before my final project here at the Iron Yard (only one day of actual lecture remains!). The prospect of shtuff getting real (i.e. no job and no longer any excuse like because I’m in school. . .) is ever present with only three weeks. . . <a href="http://casieczapski.com/2015/07/22/structure_design_greatness.html"><span class="link">Read More</span></a></p>

						<h3>Tabs on Tabs on Tabs</h3>
						<p>July 1, 2015</p>
						<p>I really thought my instructor, the lovely miss Sam Kapila, was just a little bit crazy when I first saw the number of tabs she consistently kept open in not just one, but two or three, browser windows. We’re talking twenty to thirty to fifty (ok, maybe a little excessive with fifty) tabs in just one single browser window . . . <a href="http://casieczapski.com/2015/07/01/tabs-on-tabs.html"><span class="link">Read More</span></a></p>

						<h3>Exploring Typography with Baby A's</h3>
						<p>June 25, 2015</p>
						<p>After much initial frustration attempting to create five different typography styles with TypeCast, a free online tool that happens to be super glitchy (not saving work, etc.), I finally left hours of work and started over in Photoshop. With my slight experience in Photoshop from learning how to make style tiles, I found this process much more successful. . . . <a href="http://casieczapski.com/2015/06/25/exploring-typography.html"><span class="link">Read More</span></a></p>

						<h3>Quitting My Job: 6 Weeks Out</h3>
						<p>June 17, 2015</p>
						<p>Six weeks, has it really only been six weeks? It seems more like 3 months since my Monday through Friday consisted of a rigid, 8 to 5 (well, most often a little outside of that structure, say 7 am to 6 or 7 pm…). As I’ve re-entered the blog posting world (after a very small debut of posts while living in Costa Rica several years ago) . . . <a href="http://casieczapski.com/2015/06/17/quitting-my-job.html"><span class="link">Read More</span></a></p>
