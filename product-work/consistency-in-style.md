##### Vineya Style Guide

From the very beginning, we started with a live style guide, referencing both the UI elements and Ember components to guide a consistent interface across experiences; however, as deadlines got tighter, we were unable to focus on improvements and expansions to keep the live Style Guide accurate and up to date.

Given my novice Ember skills, I decided to create a static style guide for my front end developers to reference.
