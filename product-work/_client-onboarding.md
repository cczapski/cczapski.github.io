Given the current limitations of the Deaf Client Experience iOS application, my goal was to create a brief and understandable onboarding walk through of the app's capabilities, while also emulating the Vineya style.

My biggest challenge was generating the content and copy for each screen, and breaking down the steps. I looked to the Vineya marketing website for some inspiration, and to ensure we'd be creating a consistent visual style and brand from a deaf or hard of hearing client's perspetive. 

Check out the final product below.
