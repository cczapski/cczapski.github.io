Vineya is a scheduling application that connects interpreting agencies, ASL interpreters and deaf and hard of hearing clients so that the deaf and hard of hearing community has access to interpreters whenever they need them. 

Within this product, there are five key user roles:
1. <span class="bold italic">Lighthouse Administrators</span> - internal CSD employees who manage the Lighthouse, or the agency, business and interpreter infrastructures
2. <span class="bold italic">Interpreting Agencies</span> - agencies that operate with ASL interpreters, unique businesses and organizations with a frequent need for interpreting services, and are ultimately the driving customers of Vineya
3. <span class="bold italic">Businesses of Interpreting Agencies</span> - any business that contracts with an agency to quickly and easily supply ASL interpreters for deaf employees or customers
4. <span class="bold italic">ASL Interpreters</span> - American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters who interpret ASL into spoken English
5. <span class="bold italic">Deaf/Hard of Hearing Clients</span> - any client that is deaf or hard of hearing that requires interpreting services for meetings or events with the hearing community

Each of these user roles, except for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Clients, has their own Vineya application that allows the user to achieve the main goals of their role. We are currently starting the process to create a Deaf Client Experience as an additional application to support the needs and goals of these consumers.

To understand the main purpose of the applications, I’ve outlined the most basic and important steps that surround a job or meeting request.

Despite these seven basic steps, the process gets quite a bit more complex when you take into account the extended details that surround an interpreting job from all of the different user perspectives. A large part of my responsibility is ensuring the interaction between applications and users is logical, simple, learnable and usable.

Here’s a further breakdown of the main goals and functions that each Vineya application allows its users to achieve.
