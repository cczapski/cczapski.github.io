WorldTeach consumed my last two weeks at The Iron Yard as the main focus for my final project. I chose WorldTeach because I truly understand and believe in their goals as a past year-long volunteer myself. I wanted to focus on how I could use my new design skills to improve the user's path in their own volunteer research.

Here's a bit of an in-depth walk through of my process throughout those two weeks!

##### Research & Discovery

With the two week timeframe to redesign 4 HTML pages with CSS, Sass, and jQuery, the first step in the process was research and discovery. My goal with this step was to determine the main goals of the organization and evaluate how the site design could align with those objectives - what is the core purpose and how could I use my newly formed design principles to clearly emulate that purpose to any user?

I created a <a href="https://github.com/cczapski/WorldTeach">project proposal</a> that helped discover this main goal through organization research, user interviews, competitive market analysis, SWOT, keywords, this not that, and content analysis.

Not only was I highly overwhelmed by the volume of content on the site, but I discovered most users were as well. To add to that conclusion, most users weren't sure of WorldTeach's main goal as an organization without having to dig through many pages. These conclusions led the way to defining the main goals of the redesign.

##### Core Purpose

WorldTeach's main goal is to motivate and inspire people with similar beliefs in world education to take action with their organization, whether through their time or with their money. 

With this organizational core purpose established, I developed my own core purpose and goals for the redesign - design the site to motivate and inspire action from users and create the easiest, most intuitive and logical journey through the site for any user.

##### In-depth Content Analysis

As a key next step in determining the most logical layout of content for all users, I went through as thorough of a <a href="https://github.com/cczapski/WorldTeach/blob/master/content.md">content analysis</a> possible given the time constraints of the project. 

With the large navigation on the current site, I developed a new layout structure that centers around three main users: future and current volunteers, supporters and donors, and volunteer alumni.

At this point, I chose my 4 pages and began to compile the most crucial, yet condensed (and thus less overwhelming to users) content for each page:

* Home
* For Future + Current Volunteers
* Choose Your Destination
* Costa Rica Country Page

A lot of my time centered around the content on the Costa Rica country page to attack the most content-heavy information from the get go. I ended up condensing the many paragraphs of information into bulleted lists with options to "Learn More" for the purpose of providing relevant and concise information to users first. 

Here you see a quick screenshot of the paper prototype process that ultimately led me to the final content and basic structure of the Costa Rica country page.

##### Style Exploration

Once I had a good grasp on the content, I started exploring style with three different concepts of style tiles. As I design more and more, I have begun to enjoy this process the most. I often surprise myself with the concept that ends up working the best.

For WorldTeach, the Vintage Travel Posters concept definitely creates the most motivating inspiration through the warm colors and bold, enticing font choices. User feedback agreed with this style the most and thus created the main style inspiration for the website.

##### Lo-Fi Wireframes

With the basic style developed, I moved to wireframing the ideas I explored in the content analysis. With the final layout of the country page (pictured below), a key challenge I knew I would face once I turned the layout into code was the amount of text and how they would fit around the different images for each media query size. With the time constraint on the project, I decided to face that challenge once I reached the code.

##### Basic Comps

The final step I took before jumping into code was to create basic comps through combining the style and the wireframes. I continued to focus on the Cost Rica country page with both the small and medium device sizes displayed below.

##### Final Product

The final four pages of the website are completely responsive across multiple devices and browsers. The inspiration from the vintage travel posters helps create the warm, inviting and motivating aspects needed from the site in order to fully emulate the key goal of WorldTeach.
