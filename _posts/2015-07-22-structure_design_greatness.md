Today I begin my last project before my final project here at the Iron Yard (only one day of actual lecture remains!). The prospect of shtuff getting real (i.e. no job and no longer any excuse like because I'm in school. . .) is ever present with only three weeks left, and so much still to do to prepare for the Great Search. Despite some distraction from all of the really scary events I have so quickly approaching in the near future, I find myself super excited to work on this last project before the final project: creating my first style guide.

For those of you unfamiliar, a style guide is an amazing way to provide effective standards and structure to all of the below:

- design
- code
- future fumblings with design and/or code
- many people working on the same thing all at once, and at different points in time

And for those of you who have yet to meet me (or have met me and haven't yet figured it out), I'll give you a little hint as to why I'm so excited about this project -- I absolutely love structure and organization. 

Prior to studying style guides more in depth, I heard the name early during the course amongst the other tools available to designers and developers and assumed it was simply a more detailed version of a style tile or an element collage. Today, I happily discovered that it is much more than that. Being "much  more than that" will really depend on the level of detail and depth that the creator(s) of a style guide provides, but the main point is that it's an amazing tool of direction and guidance to any user that should need to use, access or style either design or code within an existing element, component, page, or anything associated with the subject matter of the guide.

For our style guide project, we get to choose from any of the projects we have completed thus far in the course. I have chosen to create a style guide for my website redesign project of Baby Acapulco's restaurant ([current website](http://babyacapulco.com/)). I chose this project in particular for a number of reasons:

1. I love Baby A's.
2. I don't currently feel like the project is complete and have been wanting to spend more time fixing it.
3. I want to use the structure of a style guide to help add consistency within my code to improve key elements across the site and create a more cohesive design.
4. I love Baby A's.
 
To kickstart my project, I decided to take Brad Frost's great advice and create an [interface inventory](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/) to help structure the current styles and elements, and provide direction on what I should focus the content of my style guide on. You can check out my interface inventory for my original Baby A's design [here](http://cczapski.github.io/tiy_assignments/blob/master/day_43/style_guide_babyAs) (Keynote file download).

As a young coder eagerly looking for improvements in coding methods, I'm mostly excited to layout a more defined grid system and make a better attempt at object oriented CSS. Well, I leave you now to continue my journey of joining structure with design to hopefully achieve a higher level of greatness...
