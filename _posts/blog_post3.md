# Quitting My Job: 6 Weeks Out

Six weeks, has it really only been six weeks? It seems more like 3 months since my Monday through Friday consisted of a rigid, 8 to 5 (well, most often a little outside of that structure, say 7 am to 6 or 7 pm...). As I've re-entered the blog posting world (after a very small debut of posts while living in Costa Rica several years ago), I find myself reflecting on how I'm feeling to no longer have that structure, or paycheck, after making a huge leap towards a happier career.

### Highs

- Freedom!!!
- Change!!
- Flexibility!

### Lows

- No paycheck.
- Still no paycheck..
- And still no paycheck...

### Overall Feeling?

##ECSTATIC

Yes, ecstatic, and with no job or cash flow, yet. The reason, you ask? 

- A change that is new and different and challenging every day
- A change that makes me excited to wake up each morning and start a new day
- A change that gets me closer and closer to a career I actually want to be in 

The change and leap I've jumped into is the [Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/), a three-month programming bootcamp for UI Design (in case you weren't already aware of what I've leaped into). I have had absolutely no previous experience in either design, or programming, but I had almost no doubts about making the decision. It was a fairly difficult decision, with no real guarantee of landing a job after completing the school, yet it still feels so right. 

I can't help but feel that I'm going through a fairly high point while writing this blog post. Even so, and even with all the unavoidable frustrations I will continue to face both in school and in my new career, the enjoyment from coding and designing has started to be something that highly overcomes all the lows and frustrations.

I still think I'm crazy sometimes for quitting a well-paying job and jumping into the unknown, but when I think of everything I've already learned and accomplished in such a short period of time, it just seems to make perfect sense.
