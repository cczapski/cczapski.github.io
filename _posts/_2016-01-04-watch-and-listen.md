I'm finally out in the real world, real word of designing that is, working for *real* people and *real* users. Pretty exciting, I know.

I'm currently contracting with a local plastic surgeon, <a href="https://westlakeplasticsurgery.com/dr-caridi-bio/" target="_blank">Dr. Robert Caridi</a> of <a href="https://westlakeplasticsurgery.com/" target="_blank">Westlake Plastic Surgery</a> on refinements and improvements to his extensive website. One of his main business goals is to grow his gynecomastia (excess male breast tissue) practice, a niche and extension of his general cosmetic focus, with the <a href="https://westlakeplasticsurgery.com/austin-gynecomastia-center/" target="=_blank">Austin Gynecomastia Center</a>.

To achieve this goal, the doctor wants to focus on using technology to his advantage with his Virtual Consultations. Dr. C understands the hesitation, embarrasment, and caution that can come with the desire to change one's body with elective surgery, especially when it comes to males with excess breast tissue. In order to alleviate some of those feelings and cater towards out of town patients, he offers a virtual consulation where he connects with his patients through Skype, allowing them to consult with the doctor in the comfort of their home before taking the step, and potentially plane, to come into the office.

The grand website question comes into play when evaluating whether this virtual consulation option and process is or is not clear to users, particularly males with gynecomastia who do not live in Austin, from the home page. Given this grand website question, I thought it was the perfect time to try out some user testing, and my first experience with <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank">UserTesting</a>.

The first step was writing the scenario and questions. Here's what we came up with:

**Scenario**: *you have a condition called Gynecomastia, or excess male breast tissue. You're looking for treatment, and you've heard of the Austin Gynecomastia Center (AGC) with Dr. Caridi, but you don't live in Austin. You want to see if he can do a consultation either over the phone, by email, or with some form of technology so you don't have to drive to Austin before you've decided on your surgeon.*

1. **Question/Task 1**: Find out if Dr. Caridi offers any form of "virtual" consultation (something by email, video, etc.).
2. **Question/Task 2**: Using a fake name and info, submit for your choice of a Virtual Consultation (if you're not already on the page, go to this link: https://westlakeplasticsurgery.com/virtual-consultation/).
3. **Question/Task 3**: Which of the two options did you choose? And why?
4. **Question/Task 4**: If you actually had Gynecomastia and were from out of town, would you move forward with Dr. Caridi based on everything you've seen so far? Why or why not?*

The next step was submitting the tests out to three users and awaiting the results. 

The exciting step was receiving the results, then watching and listening.

 and was very intrigued to see just how the users were walking through the scenario, the website and the different questions. Overall, I was impressed by the UserTesting product and the amazing insight it provides.
