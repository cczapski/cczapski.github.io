After spending about a week and a half not touching any code and focusing on the design process, we finally got back into our black screens and started learning some basic jQuery this week. With coding as one of my favorite aspects of this course thus far, I was very excited to begin and expand upon the languages I can use to my advantage.

For practice, we were tasked to create three separate CodePens, each utilizing a different jQuery event, that would be a great addition to our last redesign project of the Goodreads website. Here's a quick snapshot of my design, produced solely in Adobe Illustrator:

##CodePen #1: Bookshelf Drop Down

The first CodePen I choose to complete was to create a bookdshelf drop down menu for the smaller version of the design.

##CodePen #2: Bookshelf Drop Down

For my second CodePen, I wanted to show what a mouse-over (or mouseenter, mouseleave) would look like when you move your mouse over a book.

##CodePen #3: 

For the final Goodreads CodePen, I wanted to play around with the main navigation using fadeIn as different tabs were selected for the varios pages.
