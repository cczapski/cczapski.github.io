I really thought my instructor, the lovely miss [Sam Kapila](https://twitter.com/samkap), was just a little bit crazy when I first saw the number of tabs she consistently kept open in not just one, but two or three, browser windows. We're talking twenty to thirty to fifty (ok, maybe a little excessive with fifty) tabs in just one single browser window. As a very organized and partially OCD person, I couldn't understand that any real need came from having that many web pages at your fingertips. I was constantly fighting the urge to walk over to her laptop and physically close out all of the tabs myself throughout our lectures.

I had not been the only person to notice Sam's tab count, as the conversation came up multiple times amongst our class. A fellow student even had his own conversation with her about her over-tab use, as she started to actively close more (let's say, maybe five out of twenty) during lectures. I very much appreciated that someone had finally mentioned something to her about her crazy tab problem, but then she mentioned something about it that actually made some sense — she kept tabs open until she was done with them (i.e. articles she wanted to read, websites she wanted to review). Yet still, how could someone need so many tabs that she wasn't finished with? I decided to try out her method for myself. 

It all started from scanning my Twitter feed before class in the morning and opening up articles and links into their own tabs that I didn't have time to read at the moment. I then started opening a new tab for each article Sam or another classmate mentioned during our lecture that I wanted to make sure to read that day as well.

Finally, when I actually got a few free moments in my day (maybe 10 open and pending tabs by the afternoon), there would be links upon links within those articles that I just had to make sure I read for later...thus, more tabs. About to minimize Chrome before bed after my first day using Sam's tab method, I suddenly realized I had become a crazy tab lady just like her!

But wait, before I could simply close everything out to absolutely feel better about sleeping with so many tabs, I had to make sure I read through everything I wanted to get out of the pages I had methodically kept open for the day. I found myself being able to keep up with more news, more design blogs and ideas, and having a way to hold myself accountable for doing so. It seems a mixture of Sam's crazy tab methods and my OCD-ness has started to lead me into a successful habit of keeping up with the times.

The whole point of all this crazy tab nonsense is that I learned something new for myself by trying to understand the way in which somebody else was operating. Rather than just accepting the fact that my instructor was simply crazy in her ways, I tried it out for myself and was able to discover a better way to personally manage my time. 

I have no doubt this will be the first time I will evaluate someone else's crazy habits or methods and learn from them to make myself better. This now has me thinking how many other areas in my life I could evaluate other methods — coding? Designing? Writing? I know the list goes on and on and on — who knows what I'll learn next!
