It's crazy what three new Iron Yard students can complete in 72 hours together. Going into my first hackathon this past weekend, I was very curious on what our Monday morning project would look like. I'm happy to say that we completed a fully functioning application, <a href="http://radlib.herokuapp.com/">Radlibs</a>!

To recap the process I went through, I've detailed out the steps I took in my first ever web design.

##Sketch Like Mad

I started with sketches, deciding to make the layout as simple as possible due not only to the time constraints of completing the project in one weekend, but also to match the simple, fun interface our users would be anticipating with the application. 

Here's a quick peek at those sketches.

<div class="sketches">

    </p>
</div>

##Style Those Tiles 

The first style direction closely mimicks the original <a href="http://www.madlibs.com/">Mad Libs</a> and gives users a reminiscent feeling of the playful books. Version 1 of the style tile employs a soft, but fun color palette with a strong emphasis on black and white to emulate the pages of text in Mad Libs books. 

Felt Tip Roman Heavy, hosted by TypeKit, was the perfect handwritten type for the light-hearted logo. The type throughout the rest of the site needed to emulate the goofy feel, but provide a more legible text type. Signo, also by TypeKit, proved a good match for these qualities.

</p>

Almost immediately I felt version one to be too obvious and easy. I wanted to create a unique identity to Radlibs to display a brighter, more age-diverse color palette and a stronger, more bold statement with the logo type. 

Version 2 holds a much more vibrant palette inspired by a fun color-box discovered during braintstorming, that eventually evolved into the user-generated quote border and Radlibs logo. Azo Sans Uber provided the bolder typeface I was looking for in the title of Radlibs.

##The Color Box

After our trio confirmed the second style would be the best fit for our users, I took the color box and was curious about creating that in CSS, so off to CodePen I went. 

<div class="codepens">
    <p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="pJWWBK" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cczapski" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/cczapski/pen/pJWWBK/'>Radlibs Color Box</a> by Casie Czapski (<a href='http://codepen.io/cczapski'>@cczapski</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
    <script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
</div>

The CodePen experiment proved successful and this CSS Color Box turned into the fun and colorful design to highlight and draw attention to the user generated quotes.

##After 72 Hours

I'm proud of the 72 hours with our Radlibs trio. I definitely got lucky with Ben and Josh as teammates. Where other teams struggled with GitHub merge conflicts and basic communication regarding key steps in the process, our biggest challenge was time and generating enough quotes to build a good database for the application.
