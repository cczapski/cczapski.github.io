A couple weeks into the Iron Yard UI Design course and we've started to sketch out existing websites. Outside of practice with basic website sketches for future designing, we were focused on visualizing the different grid systems that we thought best suited each of the 10 different websites for homework. 

Below are my 10 sketches for each of the websites.
