            <p>Casie Czapski is a McCombs UT grad and an ex sales manager who recently jumped out of her previous position to explore a career in UI Design. She is following her new-found passion of creating visually delightful designs that center around structure, logic and a little bit of common sense. As she continues to expand her new skills, Casie is looking for an organization that shares her goals of continual growth and development.</p>
            <p>Excluding the first several years of her life as a military brat, Casie was raised here in Austin, Texas. She is the middle-child of a proud Polish family and has a sheltie pup named Blue. When she's not expanding her design and coding skills, you can often find her outdoors in Austin with Blue or with a cold beer in hand next to a refreshing body of water.</p>
