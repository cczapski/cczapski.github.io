##About
Radlibs is my very first design ever. I completed the project with two wonderful teammates, Ben Hand (Ruby) and Joshua LeGrand (Front End), during an Iron Yard hackathon project (also my very first hackathon ever). For any of you who remember adlibs or madlibs, Radlibs is a play off of those word games, combining randomly generated famous quotes and user input for parts of speech. The goal of the website was to make the user's experience fun and enjoyable, full of goofy nonsense, with some good laughs along the way.
